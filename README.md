# SEMUCB-WM1-Model
- Download SEMUCB_WM1 model and codes to read it and plot it
- There are two codes, depending on the specific purpose:
  1. To obtain values of the model (Vs and xi) at a particular (radius, lon, lat) or to obtain values at a particular radius on an N x N grid - useful for plotting purposes and direct comparison with other models, download: (tar and gzipped files). Note: the values of the model in the crust are not interpretable. See French and Romanowicz (2014) for details of the crustal model.
  2. To predict waveforms, dispersion curves, or travel times of particular phases using SEMUCB_WM1, here is a code that allows you to construct 1D depth profiles of the model at a particular (lat, lon) location: (tar and gzipped files)
